# Token-Exchange-Test

This project is a playground allowing me to play with different
forms of oAuth/OIDC.

For the local version of an AS/OP I am using PingFederate docker image,
which is found at [GitHub - PingFederate](http://github.com/PingIdentity),
and the oAuthPlayground they provide to set up basic oAuth/OIDC endpoints.
